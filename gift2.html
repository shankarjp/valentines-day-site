      <p>
        Kaju Katli is sweet,<br />
        And so are you,<br />
        My happiest days,<br />
        Are the ones with you 💕<br /><br />

        Because somehow, in a world so loud,<br />
        You feel like peace. 🤍<br />
        In a life so fast,<br />
        You feel like home. 🏠❤️<br /><br />

        I miss us…<br />
        The old days of endless memories,<br />
        And I can't wait to make a million more. ✨<br /><br />

        This Valentine's Day is a little far, 🥺<br />
        But our love is closer than ever. 🫶🏻<br /><br />

        One day, I'll steal you away forever 🥰<br />
        Into a life full of hugs and laughter 🫂<br /><br />

        Happy Valentine's Day, my love. 💖<br />
        My Abikutty 💌∞<br />
